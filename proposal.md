1.) Hardware: Switches 3:0 will be used to create a hex value (0-F) that will be used to drive the three LEDs consecutively. Pushbutton 1 will change the value of
the red LED with the first press, green with second press, and blue with the third that will be a brightness dictated by the discrete value given by the switches.
Pushbutton 2 will switch from the switch control to the potentiometer control.

2.) Software: Using my custom hardware component, when the hardware is set to the switch mode, the software will tell the user what the values given to the R,
G, and B are (0-F)
